# Wills_et_al_2023_Survival_SNPs
Scripts for completing GWAS and MAGMA analyses used in Wills et al. 2023

To analyse the associaiton of CRC risk SNPs/genes with overall survival in the COIN/COIN-B cohorts, the multivariate GWAS results presented in Wills et al. 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2021.09.047) are used. 
Example commands for performing this analysis are presented in SNP_and_gene_level_analysis.R along with preparation of gwas summary statistics for gene-level analysis and an example of the power analyses. 

The commands used to produce gene-level results from GWAS summary statistics and the shell software package MAGMA are detailed in MAGMA_analysis.sh
